\title{Convert ENSMBL IDs to Gene Names}
\usage{
swap_ensmbl_for_names(matrix, species = c("mouse", "human"))
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Input matrix with rownames as ENSMBL IDs (i.e, as accessed by Seurat::GetAssayData(object, assay, slot))}

\item{species}{Character, either "mouse" or "human" are currently supported.}
}
\value{
Output matrix with rownames converted from ENSMBL IDs to gene names.
}
\description{
This is a helper function to simplify the conversion of matrix rownames formatted in ENSMBL ID format (i.e., ENSMUSG00000051951) to the corresponding
gene name (i.e, Xkr4). This is mostly a helper tool for late stages of analysis with Seurat objects, where you want to make plots showing gene names,
or you need to format with gene names as input for other analysis tools. This is also used for preparing the files needed for uploading of datasets
to the Single Cell Portal.
}
\details{
The approach uses reference tables from the \code{annotables} package for the conversion purposes. The grcm38 and grch38 are used for conversion for mouse and human, respectively.
One-to-many mapping issues are handled by only replacing the ENSMBL ID if it maps to a unique gene name.
If multiple ENSMBL IDs map to the same gene symbol, then the feature name is left in ENSMBL format.
